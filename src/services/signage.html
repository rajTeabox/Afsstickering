                    3D sign letters are made by cutting a sheet of material on a cnc-cutter to the shape and size of the letters or words that you need. The letters are then fabricated and hand finished to create the depth of the letters. We’re able to make the letters to the exact specifications of the design that you need and there is a vast range of fonts which we’re able to machine the letters to. The letters can either be fixed flush to the wall or raised off the wall with brackets.

                    <div class="abt-content">
                            Our LED signs are made from a single piece of ACP panel which is folded into a tray and then braced and riveted to ensure rigidity, your letters are then routed out and then backed with opaque Acrylic Panel
                            <br><br>
                            Inside the aluminum tray, High Quality LEDs are used to shine through the acrylic giving the sign a backlit sign effect. Our Custom Lighted Signs will help you stand out during the day and at night.
                            <br><br>
                            Possibly one of the most popular signage solutions. The LED Signage’s  is a quick and easy method to promote your business with the benefit of continuous LED illumination at a very low energy consumption.
                            <br><br>
                            Aluminum Composite is a fantastic material for sign fascia’s as its light weight, cost-effective and easily to produce for a fast turnaround. In many cases, if the colour you wanted isn’t one of the standard supplied color’s then we can vinyl wrap the fascia to achieve the colour you need. This material is not as strong as actual aluminum so it has a slightly shorter life span however it’s a cheaper alternative and ideal for many signs. 
                            <br><br>
                            The aluminum composite fascia can then be sign written in a number of ways including vinyl decals, flat cut letters and raised 3D letters.
                            <br><br>
                            The logo or text is individually cut from pre-colored vinyl film which is fitted to the face of the sign. This method of sign writing ensures all the graphics are fixed flush to the fascia panel and allows for changes to be made to the panel at a later date for example if the phone number changes or if the shop name changes. The vinyl decals can also be printed so you're able to display a photographic image on the sign or if a particular pantone colour or CMYK colour is needed for the text or logo.

                            Because the tray panel has folded edges it means the fixings used to secure the fascia to the shop front are well hidden which displays a cleaner tidier finish, unlike flat sign panels which requires the fixings to the fixed through the face of the tray.

                            Made from a flat sheet of aluminum which is machine folded to make the sign ridged and to create some depth to the sign. The sign tray is then sign written with flat cut acrylic letters or shapes to make up the logo. The acrylic letters can either be fixed flush to the fascia panel so that it creates a slightly raised effect or they can be fitted to raised brackets to create more of a three dimensional effect. With a range of acrylic color’s to choose from, the possibilities are endless and we can also combine acrylic letters with vinyl decals so parts of the sign are raised and other parts are flush.

                            The shop name or logo is then laser-cut out from the sign and removed which allows the internal lights to shine through and illuminated the letters clearly. Also known as stencil cut fascias, this method of sign making is hugely popular as it ensures the brand name is clearly visible and the production costs are much more cost-effective compared to 3D built up illuminated letters.

                                Metal Signage’s is commonly used in the manufacturing of external signs due to its durability. Unlike some other materials there is no oxidisation or Rust that occurs with an Metal sign. So your sign will stay looking just as great as the day it arrived for many years to come. We use the highest quality materials when making all of our Metal signs.
                                <br><br>
                                Metal letters and logos are used as reliable forms of signage across the board from large buildings, offices and businesses to retail outlets, restaurants, schools and warehouses. Metal lettering ultimately displays a classy look which you don’t get from other production methods and it denotes permanence, reliability and dependability. Our choice of metals range from polished metal, brushed metal, rusted metal and painted metal.
                                <br><br>
                                Built up letters give you a three dimensional feel to your sign which makes them stand out from flat cut lettering. This type of metal lettering is manufactured from a flat metal sheet and fabricated to produce each unique letter.
                                <br><br>
                                The built up letters consist of a "letter face" which is displayed on the front of the sign and a "return side" which is also visible when fixed to the wall. This method gives the illusion that the letters are solid when in actual fact they're hollow. The advantages in using this method is it reduces the cost as well as the weight of the shop sign so they can be displayed and fixed to virtually any wall or front of shop.
                                <br><br>
                                These type of letters are made to order in a range of fonts, sizes and styles. The shape of the letter is laser cut from a flat sheet of metal. A strip of metal is folded around the side of the letter to create the return side and depth of the letters. This is usually soldered onto the side of the letter and a range of return sizes are used depending on how thick or chunky you'd like the letters to look.

                                The letters are then fitted to the wall with a two part nut and bolt fixing. The male-part of the fixing is welded onto the back of the letter. The female-part of the fixing is fitted onto the wall. The two parts of the fixing then slot together and are tightened up securely with a spanner to ensure they're securely into position.

                                <h3>Flat Cut Raised letters</h3>
                                Flat cut letters are also designed to give you a three dimensional feel to your sign – they’re just not as chunky as the Built Up 3D Metal Letters. This type of metal lettering is manufactured from a flat metal sheet and fabricated to produce each unique letter.
                                <br><br>
                                The flat-cut letters consist of a "letter face" which is displayed on the front of the sign and not a "return side". The advantages in using this method is it reduces the cost compared to the built-up letters as well as the weight of the shop sign so they can be displayed and fixed to virtually any wall or front of shop.
                                <br><br>
                                These types of letters are made to order in a range of fonts, sizes and styles. The shape of the letter is laser cut from a flat sheet of metal. The letters are then fitted to the wall with a two part nut and bolt fixing. The male-part of the fixing is welded onto the back of the letter. The female-part of the fixing is fitted onto the wall. The two parts of the fixing then slot together and are tightened up securely with a spanner to ensure they're securely into position.

                                    A roll-up consists of an aluminum banner cassette which stands on the ground with double foldout base supports. You then simply pull the banner up out of the cassette and secure it at the rear using a support pole. The material has a grey reverse and blocks out all light, with a print surface that is non-reflective. Recommended for virtually all public environments, such as offices, fairs, shops, hospitals, hotels, etc. where environmentally certified material is a requirement.

We can also create customized signs with a short turnaround. Our signs are available in a range of materials, including self-adhesive vinyl, rigid plastics, glow in the dark, Sun boards, ACP and a huge range of sign sizes.

                                        The responsibility of businesses extends beyond maximizing profits and ensuring efficient business processes. Creating a safe working environment for employees and contractors and a safe environment for local residents are just as important. Compliance with occupational health and safety legislation or other international legislation and regulations and standards is a basic requirement. For this reason, safety signage should be an integral part of any business’ safety measures.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If multiple hazards, prohibitions or instructions have to be communicated, composite signs are the most effective. These combined signs inform the employees, contractors and visitors about hazards, prohibitions or instructions. The information is arranged accessibly on a sign designed to fit the situation. It is possible to provide that information together with corporate branding elements; however, corporate branding usage is always subordinate to the safety message. Signs & Safety also pays a great deal of attention to the use of materials for the signs in relation to their use and location in the environment. We primarily use high-quality retro-reflective foils to increase the visibility of the signs considerably, both during the day and at night.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Safety signage a pictogram is the image used to convey the message of the sign. In statutory signage pictograms follow a very specific set of colour, shape and sizing rules. For this to work the image must be kept consistent. In its purest form a pictogram on a sign should be understood even if there is no text present. Following the standard colour and shape rules increase the likely hood of a universally understood pictogram and therefore sign.<br><br>
                                        Safety Signs have very specific shapes. These shapes on signs send messages to the audience and form a set of rules that should be followed. This guidance is for employers and duty holders, and others who have responsibility for the control of work sites and premises, or operating equipment requiring verbal and/or non-verbal communications.
