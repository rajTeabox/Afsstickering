                            If you are looking to completely renovate your flooring, vinyl flooring is an excellent and versatile option. It comes in many colors, such as browns, greys, blacks and tans, and it also comes in a variety of finishes, types, styles and looks. Vinyl flooring comes in low and medium gloss levels, and they’re offered in click, floating, glue down and nail down installation types.
                            <br><br>
                            Vinyl seeps the pattern and design through the entire thickness of the vinyl flooring, making it heavier and more resistant to chipping and scratching. Your budget will essentially determine which type of vinyl style will suit you best. This type of vinyl flooring is supplied in continuous and flexible sheets that are durable, water-resistant, affordable and versatile in design.
                            <br><br>
                            Other than being durable and comfortable, one of the most notable benefits of vinyl flooring is that it can come in a variety of finishing looks that are sure to match your client’s style. Whether you like traditional or contemporary designs, you are bound to find something you like in vinyl flooring.<br><br>Some of the look finishes we offer at AFS STICKERING Wholesale include the following:
                            <br>
                            <div>
                                <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
                                    <li>Bamboo</li>

                                    <li>Concrete</li>
                                    <li>Linen</li>
                                    <li>Pattern</li>
                                    <li>Stone</li>
                                    <li>Wood</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <br>
                            Another benefit of vinyl flooring is that it reduces the noise of footsteps, which is perfect if you have children or pets. Vinyl flooring is also more affordable than other flooring options, and it’s easy to clean and maintain. Thanks to its durability, experts say this type of flooring can last you anywhere from 5 to 10 years, making it one of the longer lasting flooring options.
                            <br><br>
                            To care for vinyl flooring, all that’s necessary is a regular vacuum and a soapy mop. This will keep vinyl flooring looking shiny and new. We suggest staying away from bleach, ammonia and abrasives, as they might ruin the vinyl material. 
                            <br><br>
                            Vinyl flooring is making a comeback, and these days this flooring option is seen as trendy and modern. If you want to stay up-to-date with the times, this type of flooring would be perfect.
                            <br><br>
                            Vinyl flooring allows you to achieve your dream home style without breaking the bank. Its average lifespan has a minimum of five years, but can last as long as the house if properly cleaned and maintained.

                            <h3>Quality over price</h3>
                            Like all things in life, you get what you pay for. Higher quality carpets tend to cost more upfront, but they have greater pile density and a tighter twist construction which makes them more durable. This ultimately leads to a longer lifespan.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Cushioning</h3>
                            Cushioning is the layer of comfortable spongy material that sits between the carpet and the floor. This padding can also help preserve the carpet so it lasts longer and serves as a safeguard against everyday wear and tear. Splurge a little on the cushioning of your carpet flooring, and we promise you won’t be disappointed.

                            <h3>Four Common Carpet Fibers</h3>
                            Fun fact: More than 90 percent of carpet made today is made out of synthetic fiber. There are four types of synthetic fibers, which include polyester, nylon, triexta and polypropylene, and there are two main types of natural fibers, which include wool and sisal.
                            <br><br>
                            Here’s a list of the four most common fiber varieties of carpet.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Wool</h3>
                            This natural fiber is durable and stain resistant, and it’s an environmentally friendly flooring option.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Nylon</h3>
                            This is the most popular fiber used in carpets, thanks to its durability and resistance to wear-and-tear. We recommend getting a stain-resistant treatment with this carpet flooring, especially if you’re prone to spilling or staining carpets.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Olefin</h3>
                            This fiber type is best if you need a carpet that is resistant to moisture and molding — perfect for your basement or outdoor seating area. Although it’s not exactly the most comfortable carpet type, it makes up in durability.
                            <br><br>
                            <h3>Polyester</h3>
                            This carpet fiber is extremely stain and fade-resistant, and it is economically friendly. It also boasts softness and is durable against everyday wear-and-tear.

                                    <div class="accordion"><span>Why Choose Carpet Flooring?</span></div>
                                    <div class="panel">
                                        <p>Carpet flooring looks great in an Office or Home, is a comfortable flooring option, and has potential to last  a lifetime if properly cared for. Here are six main reasons to consider carpet flooring:
                                        </p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>It’s soft.</b> This is probably the biggest appeal of carpet flooring, as carpet fibers obviously feel great on  bare feet.</li>
                                            <li><b>It’s comfortable. </b> To add to the softness, carpet flooring adds a sense of comfort, and is great for rooms where you’ll be more inclined to stand for long periods of time or sit on the floor.<br> Think about it this way — would you rather sit on hardwood or carpet? That’s what we thought.</li>
                                            <li><b>It’s warm. </b> Unlike tile or hardwood, carpet flooring is great at insulating heat, making this type of flooring glorious on cold winter mornings.</li>
                                            <li><b>It’s an economical option. </b> Carpet flooring is a lot less expensive than hardwood and some tile flooring options.</li>
                                            <li><b>It’s safe. </b> Carpet provides a cushion, making it a softer landing for any trips or falls.</li>
                                            <li><b>It reduces sounds and noises in the home. </b> Thanks to the natural insulation of carpet flooring, noise levels in the home are greatly reduced. The carpet serves as a padding so noise can’t bounce around the home’s rooms as easily.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                </div>

                                        <div class="accordion"><span>Why Choose Wooden Flooring?</span></div>
                                        <div class="panel">
                                            <p>There are many benefits to installing wood floors. All of the following are reasons you should consider going with Wooden Flooring:       
                                            </p>
                                            <b>Durability</b><br>
                                            <p>If you care for your hardwood floors the right way, they can last for over a century. All you need to do is sweep, vacuum, and use a wood floor cleaner on occasion. 
                                                </p>
                                            <b>Versatility</b><br>
                                            <p>Another appealing feature of hardwood is versatility. This type of flooring works with many different styles of decor. Whether you want a traditional or a modern look, there’s a hardwood floor that can match your style. 
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                    You can sand and stain your wood to give it a unique effect. And if you ever want to change it, you can sand and stain it again.

                                                </p>
