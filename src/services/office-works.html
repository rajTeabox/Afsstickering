                                    <p>Frosted window film is a thin self-adhesive or self-cling material commonly known as sticky back plastic. Once applied, the film gives windows the appearance of frosted glass making it opaque which is ideal for 24-hour privacy, or to obscure an unsightly view.</p>

                                <div class="panel">
                                    <p>The plain frosted film is ideal for most privacy-related purposes and is the perfect a home or office setting. It is colorless and looks very subtle when applying to the glass. Our white frost film is denser and more opaque, making it ideal for bathrooms.  The etch effect films have a sparkly finish OR Matt Finish, Regular frost film is a 4 & 5 Feet Height, film making it ideal for glass partitions and large panes of glass.

                                    We can also create a design to your own specification â€“ or perhaps youâ€™d prefer to give our creative team an idea and leave it to them. We would charge extra for this service, but we think youâ€™ll find itâ€™s still very affordable and youâ€™ll have a design that means so much to you. For a business, that might be based on your logo or brand image.
                                    </p>
