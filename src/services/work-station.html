                                        <p>Most of our wooden furniture ranges like office desks, conference tables, cabinets etc are manufactured using the highest quality of E1 grade MDF, hard wood and natural wood veneer that impart a rich and luxurious look and feel to the furniture. There are also some product ranges that are made with laminates.

                                        <p>Medium density fiber board (MDF) is a high grade, composite material that performs better than solid wood in many areas. Made from recycled wood fibers and resin, MDF is machine dried and pressed to produce dense, dimensionally stable sheets. Its smooth, controlled surface allows it to be easily painted, carved, rounded and applied with wood veneers and is a world standard for manufactured furniture.</p>

                                        <p>Yes the glass partitions we have can be fitted to a suspended ceiling. The U channel should fixed directly to metal frame work of the suspended ceiling. The metal framework should then be reinforced above the ceiling tiles.

                                        <p>The glass is toughened which means it cannot be cut down or changed in anyway. However if our stock panels do not fit your requirement we can custom make glass panels to any shape or size.

                                        <p>A 5mm gap should be left between each glass panel and this gap should then be filled with clear silicon. This joins the glass panels together, adds strength and rigidity to the wall and significantly improves the sound proofing of the room.
